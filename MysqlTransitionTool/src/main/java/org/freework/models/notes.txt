The ultimate objective is to have models that support both databases.

I expect most models will be like this. Any models like this should be placed in the 'common' folder.

Having the models in 'common' is the best case since you can directly compare those models with data from 2 databases.

If you need to have models that are DB-specific, place them into their respective DB folder.
