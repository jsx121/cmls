Organize the SQL maps by database and then in whichever packages make the most sense, like
obviously a module will be top-level under a database-specific folder.

Keep things as organized as possible.

I'm not using the "master" terminology and it's a term being phased out in the industry.

Instead, the "master" SQL map files for MyBatis are called "config" here and will contain
all the configuration details for a specific DB client.
